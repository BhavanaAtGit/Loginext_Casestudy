/*
I found this problem is of efficient resource allocation.  
At first look, one might think of graphs, but this is not a problem of path finding, 
itâ€™s about allocating drivers when they become free.  

Initially, I thought of using a simple queue to implement FIFO for driver allocation.  
A circular queue also came to mind for efficiency, but the challenge here is that  
drivers become free at different times and not necessarily in the same order they were assigned.  

So, instead of using just a queue, I chose a **min-heap (priority queue)** to keep track of busy drivers,  
sorted by the time they become free. This way, we can quickly find and release the driver  
who gets free the earliest, which ensures efficient allocation.
